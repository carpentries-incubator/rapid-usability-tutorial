### What and How to Contribute
There are many ways to contribute, and we’d love for you to get involved:

#### Substantial changes
If you have an idea for a bigger change (like adding or re-working lesson content), please start by opening an [issue](repo-issues). This gives us a chance to discuss how your idea fits with the lesson goals before you spend time writing. You don’t need to write the lesson yourself if you don’t want to. Sharing the idea is already valuable.

When suggesting new exercises or material, please estimate how long they would take to teach.
Also let us know what you would remove to make space. This helps us keep lessons focused and realistic.

#### Small fixes
If you find typos, broken links, or other quick improvements, go ahead and open a pull request with the fix. If you’re not sure how, just open an [issue][repo-issues] or [email the maintainers][contact] and we’ll help.

#### Comments and reviews
Feedback is as important as new content. Commenting on issues or reviewing pull requests helps improve lessons for everyone. Fresh eyes are especially useful—novices often notice what experienced users overlook.

#### Website template
If you’d like to change the lesson website template itself, please see [The Carpentries Workbench][template-doc] documentation. Lesson maintainers handle content only, not the template.

### Roles and Recognition
A formal governance structure for this lesson is still being established; the procedures
for decision making and contributing may change. If you have thoughts on this,
you can share them by [opening an issue][issues]. In the interim, we
recognize three roles for people working on this project: contributors, maintainers, and creators.

#### Maintainers
Maintainers are contributors that have a formal responsibility keeping this lesson usable by the community.
This involves reviewing and integrating contributions. If you reach out about this lesson
or other STRUDEL projects via GitHub or email, it is likely you will get a response from one of our maintainers.

Presently, Hannah Cohoon of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's [STRUDEL project](https://strudel.science/) is the lesson's primary maintainer.
