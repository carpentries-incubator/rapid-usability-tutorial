<p>User experience research (UXR) is the investigation of how people
interact with, make sense of, and respond to technology and services.
Often, your goal with UXR will be to improve the usability of your
product, making it easier to adopt and use.</p>
<p>Usability is made up of other attributes that determine how easy to
use a technology or service is. <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/" class="external-link">Nielsen
Norman Group</a>, a respected authority on usability and user research,
identifies several characteristics of usability (lightly adapted
here):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Learnability</em>: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic
tasks the first time they encounter the design?</li>
<li>
<em>Efficiency</em>: Once users have learned the design, how quickly
can they perform tasks?</li>
<li>
<em>Memorability</em>: When users return to the design after a
period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish
proficiency?</li>
<li>
<em>Errors</em>: How many errors do users make, how severe are these
errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?</li>
<li>
<em>User satisfaction</em>: How pleasant is it to use the design?
How positive or negative are users’ feelings about the tool?</li>
<li>
<em>Utility</em>: Does it do what users need? Does it enable users
to accomplish their goals?</li>

<p>In the skit you’ll watch, a study facilitator guides a participant
through a rapid usability test. For the purposes of this tutorial, you
have the view a participant would. This means you can see the
participant’s screen when the facilitator would (as they complete a
task) and times when the facilitator would not be able to see their
screen (as they reply to a survey).</p>
<p>After the skit is over, we’ll discuss the skit as a group: What was
interesting to you? What was confusing? What aspects of usability do you
think this study could address?</p>

<figure><img src="fig/ep1_infographic.png" alt="An infographic on User Experience Research and Rapid Usability testing" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>There are many methods to study user experiences. You could do
interviews, observation, participatory design, A/B testing, surveys,
contextual inquiry, card sorting, or one of many more options.</p>
<p>Rapid usability testing is a kind of user research experience that
focuses on how a small number of users interact with a specific
software, technology, or service—it evaluates the experience. Rapid
usability testing is meant to help you make decisions about how to
design your tool and user experience. It’s not academic level rigor,
it’s meant to be quick and good enough to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>In a testing session a researcher will ask a participant to perform a
series of tasks or respond to a set of prepared prompts related to the
tool being tested. Tasks should be well scoped; this makes them quick to
accomplish and results easier to interpret. The researcher will observe
the participant’s behavior, may ask them to ‘think aloud’ as they
perform the task, and will ask follow-up questions when necessary. Only
3-10 participants are needed, fewer if you include any interview
questions as a follow up to your tasks. Five is a norm for sample size
in usability testing.</p>
<p>You may wish to use rapid usability testing in order to compare user
populations or design options. For example, “Do people prefer X or Y
design?” You might find sometimes that neither design option is good
but, especially if you have follow-up interview questions, you can learn
why and can still integrate some improvement into the code quickly.</p>
<p>Because usability tests are used to assess some interface and offer
insights, this means that you must have something for users to work with
during the test. That could be a tool or service already available for
use. Alternatively, you can create an interactive prototype using tools
designed for this purpose, such as Balsamiq or Figma. Or, maybe you have
a paper prototype people interact with. Whatever you have does not have
to be final or perfect, but you need something for users to interact
with.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rae is going to develop a gold standard dataset of journal article
submissions, tagged with their venues, peer review outcomes, and reasons
for acceptance or rejection. Rae will develop a tool that assesses draft
articles for their probability of successful publication.</li>
<li>Chung previously made their software package PHANCY accessible via
downloads on their personal website; users could install the downloaded
files. Chung recently made PHANCY installable with the pip package
management system. He’s gotten a bunch of emails from users having
trouble with pip though.</li>
<li>Sam wrote a script that helps their two labmates automate some
common tasks. Sam was thinking the script might be more useful if it
also logged in a shared spreadsheet when it was executed and by
whom.</li>

<p>This is a bit subjective but it comes down to whether or not you have
something for people to work with, people to talk to, and something you
want to learn about. Rae is probably too early in development given they
don’t seem to have any kind of tool for users to work with. Chung seems
like they would benefit from usability testing. Sam might have too few
people for any kind of quantitative evaluation but talking to the
labmates would likely be useful.</p>

<p>Rapid Usability Testing is one of many approaches in UXR. There are a
variety of methods which may be better suited for different scenarios,
circumstances, and/or phases in the product lifecycle. For example, user
discovery sessions may be a good fit for when a general concept is known
but an associated tool or service does not yet exist (more on the
discovery phase <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/discovery-study-guide/" class="external-link">here</a>;

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>A task should be something that users actually want to do that can be
accomplished in a short period of time. When defining tasks for your
rapid usability test, keep in mind that you usually don’t want to test
users’ reading comprehension—you want to test the usability of the
interface. Thus, avoid using terms visible in the interface in your task
description. Nielsen Norman <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/better-usability-tasks/" class="external-link">has
additional advice</a> on how to craft good task prompts.</p>

</h3>
<figure><img src="fig/ep2ex_avoidLang.png" alt="A screenshot of Slack that shows 'Reply in thread' as tooltip content." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>After you’ve selected tasks for your usability study, time yourself
completing study tasks to establish a baseline. To prevent fatigue, you
want to aim for your session to be under 30 minutes. Allowing 10 minutes
for non-task activities like instructions and interview questions means
you should have no more than 20 minutes for task completion. Reduce the
number or complexity of tasks you have planned if needed.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>To answer your research questions, you need metrics. Determine what
these will be before you start collecting data. The number and choice of
metrics will be a judgment call only you and your team can make. Metrics
might be countable and observable things like seconds or minutes, number
of clicks, or number of errors. Metrics could also be gathered via a
survey question that uses a scale, such as confidence on a scale (1, not
at all confident – 5, completely confident) or level of agreement that
the tool has the needed functionality (1, strongly disagree – 5,
strongly agree).</p>

pretty far.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>It is important that you give each of your participants the same
experience when they join your study, so that results are comparable
across participants. You want to avoid giving hints or causing
confusion. You also want participants to feel comfortable talking with
you. Following a script and prepping the test environment will make sure
you succeed in these goals. The script should cover everything you’ll
say to a participant so that someone else can stand in for you and still
run the exact same study.</p>

</h3>
<p>Often, when verbally asked a question that uses a Likert style scale
(e.g., “On a scale of one to five, how easy was this task for you?”),
participants will hesitate to provide a number and might give a more
expansive answer. We recommend sending <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ojRiqvnWwkDYMTYNXFed0BcuZnLZEyTCpsh_Rl2bcU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.1hjb3shsggu" class="external-link">self-report
questions</a> like this as survey questions instead of asking them out
loud. Google Forms are a simple way to do this.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/ep2ex_form.png" alt="A screenshot of Google Forms showing two questions: What is your participant ID? and Overall the task was 'blank.' The second question has the option to respond on a 1-5 scale of very easy to very difficult." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>After you have prepared your script, ask someone to help you pilot
(i.e., test out) your study. Ideally you would do this pilot with
someone who would make a good participant, but that benefit should be
balanced against the need to include eligible people in your actual
study. Run the pilot session exactly as you would a real session and
keep track of any needed changes to your script; it’s very important
that the tasks themselves are easily understood. This is also an
opportunity to ensure the study takes an appropriate amount of time. Run
multiple pilots if needed.</p>

</div>
<span class="callout-header">Key Points</span>
<div class="callout-inner">
<div class="callout-content">
<ul>
<li>Rapid usability testing should involve observing participants for no
more than an hour, preferably less than 30 minutes. Choose the number of
tasks you ask participants to complete based on your priorities and how
much time you have available.</li>
<li>Task prompts should be goals users might have and should not use
language visible in your user interface.</li>
<li>Evaluation criteria should be determined in advance. Multiple
criteria can be used to evaluate a single concept like ease of use.</li>
<li>Without specialized software, capturing some data like clicks or
idle time may be difficult. However, many other common metrics are
relatively simple to evaluate if you can record a session and/or present
survey questions. If you are evaluating a command line tool, you may ask
participants to copy their terminal contents and email them to you at
the end of the session.</li>
<li>When asking participants survey questions, do not do so verbally.
Make sure you have a way of associating their anonymous response with
their recorded session; anonymous participant IDs are a good
choice.</li>
<li>Preparing a script and the test environment ensures you run the same
test with each participant and helps make sure you gather all the data
you meant to.</li>
<li>Your test sessions should begin with some orientation and rapport
building, then move on to the tasks before wrapping up.
<ul>
<li>During orientation, introduce yourself and outline what will happen
during the study. Reassure participants that they are not being
tested—only the tool is being evaluated.</li>
<li>When building rapport, ask the participant a question about
themselves that they can confidently answer.</li>
<li>When presenting the tasks, try to order them so that your most
prioritized tasks go first, ensuring you get to them. If there is a
logical sequence to them, you might apply that structure instead.</li>
<li>In your script, include links to any appropriate webpages or survey
questions so you can easily share this information with participants;
put them next to the appropriate task, not at the top of the page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You will need to link any anonymous survey responses to their study
session. A simple way is to assign each participant an ID number and
tell them this ID number before sending them the survey; they can then
enter that into the survey.</li>
<li>Piloting your study helps ensure you have accurate estimates of how
long a session will take, helps refine your script and environment
set-up, and can inspire additional questions or tasks to include.
However, if you anticipate difficulty recruiting, you should limit your
piloting so that you don’t practice with too many potential actual
participants.</li>

<p>When deciding who to recruit for your study, consider who your tool
is meant to support, in what settings, and how. Sometimes this is called
a <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/creating-a-value-proposition" class="external-link">value
proposition</a>—it’s a statement of benefits. By considering what
benefits you offer and to whom, you can identify the general type of
person you should be recruiting for your study because this is also your
target user audience.</p>
<p>Your research question can also be helpful when determining who to
recruit as it may include some prerequisite requirements.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Once you know what type of person you want to talk to, you’ll next
need to decide how many users you’d like to have in your study. There
are no wrong answers here; what is important is that you feel
comfortable with the data you’ve gathered and can use that data to make
informed design decisions. If you are seeking statistical significance,
you will need to recruit many more participants than you would
otherwise. However, because rapid usability testing is easily applied in
an iterative development process and because <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-many-test-users/" class="external-link">you don’t
need very many participants to gain insights</a>, we recommend testing
with up to 10 people.</p>
<p>While usability studies outside of scientific software usually offer
an incentive for participation, such as a gift card, this is often not
needed for scientific software. Scientists and researchers often
genuinely want to see improvements in the tools they rely on for their
work and to help their fellow researchers; a sense of community and
shared interest is generally a sufficient motivator. Additionally, they
often appreciate helping to shape the software’s future direction. Thus,
while an incentive like a gift card is nice, it is not necessary.</p>
<p>When recruiting, most strangers you reach out to will say no. If you
are recruiting from people you are regularly in contact with, you can
expect higher and more positive response rates.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Unless your study is time bound in some way, recruitment can happen
in phases.</p>
<p>We recommend direct, individualized emails to recruit participants
for your study if possible. This approach means that you have a record
of when and who you reached out to and personalized requests can be more
effective than broad canvassing with flyers or posts to forums. If you
have or can find contact information for your users or eligible
participants, leverage it to send these emails.</p>
<p>A common risk participants in user studies face is a breach of
confidentiality, meaning their opinions or data get shared with
unexpected people in a way that compromises their anonymity. With rapid
usability testing, most of the study will involve participants engaging
with your tool in routine ways, so no unusual risk should be added.
However, you might be asking some interview questions or participants
might volunteer information they wish to keep private. Be sure to state
how you will handle participants’ data: Will you anonymize it? Who will
have access to the data? Will you keep any identifiable information?
Will you ever publish the data? Providing this information is important
for ensuring participants can make informed decisions about
participation.</p>

<p>Hi _______,</p>
<p>I am a researcher working with PHANCY and am conducting user studies
to improve our installation process. I understand you are a PHANCY user
and hoped we could learn from your experience. Might you have thirty
minutes some time in the next couple of weeks to participate in one of
these user studies?</p>
<p>During the study session, I would observe you doing some typical
tasks using PHANCY, focusing on how you install updates to the package.
I’d record and transcribe the session but only I would have access to
those raw files—the broader PHANCY team would only be shown anonymized
content so that you can be completely open during the interview. Once
I’ve finished anonymization I will delete the raw files completely and
retain only anonymous data in our private cloud storage. We’ll only use
your data to guide our internal decision making; this isn’t for
publication. Participation is completely voluntary.</p>
<p>If you’re able to participate, please share a day and time that would
work well for you.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration!</p>
<p>best wishes,</p>

<p>Recruitment is often the most difficult part of any study with human
participants. You might find that emails are not effective enough and
you need to find more people. You may also be trying to recruit people
who have never used your tool and that can be a surprisingly difficult
type of person to reach.</p>
<p>Snowball sampling is one approach to increasing your advertising
efforts. Snowball sampling is when a potential participant refers the
researcher to additional potential participants. This is great for
recruitment but can introduce bias and must be done with care to protect
participants’ privacy.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>You’ll need a central place where you can keep track of who you have
recruited and when/if they will be participating. Create a spreadsheet
for this. It can be especially useful to also include when people were
contacted and followed up with as well as links to session transcripts
or recordings and notes. See the image below or follow <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sNjgCn-u8R545Au8ypEXyH_2Kf5mWtgzP_qRw6aPAwY/edit?gid=0#gid=0" class="external-link">this
link</a> to a template participant tracker that you can make a copy of
and use yourself.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/ep3_recruit.png" alt="A screenshot of a Google Sheet with columns for Participant ID, Name, Email, Session date and more." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>In your participant tracker, assign participants anonymous IDs like
Participant 1 or P1 so that you can identify them and their data without
using their name. The private tracker should be the only location where
you link anonymous IDs to identifiable information. If you don’t have to
record identifiable information, don’t. You likely don’t need things
like age, gender, or race and it is possible you don’t even need
participant names or contact information.</p>
<p>Including links in that tracker to notes and recordings means you are
associating private information with identifying information like the
participant’s name or email. That makes it very important that this be a
confidential, private document accessible only to the people that
participants agreed to. Make sure to save it in an appropriate location,
preferably somewhere password protected. We recommend keeping a private
folder for this tracker and any raw (non-anonymized) data. If you were
using cloud storage like Google Drive for your study, you might use a
folder structure like this:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/ep3_folders.png" alt="Two screenshots of different Google Drive folders with annotations indicating which content should be shared and which should be confidential. Raw data and the participant tracker are marked confidential." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>To make the most of your recruitment efforts and facilitate future
studies, you can keep a separate list of people who consent to be
contacted about additional user research opportunities. Ask at the end
of a study session or via email if it’s okay to reach out again in
future. When you do contact those people again, explain that they
previously consented to this and ensure they know they can ask to be
removed from your list. Keep this list, your participant pool, in a
separate location from study data and do not record anything in the list
about which research people have engaged in or how they came to be
included in the list. It should be private so that only people directly
involved in study recruitment have access. You can enable people to join
this list by creating and sharing a sign up form.</p>

<p>Having determined your tasks and written a script for your study
sessions, prepared your <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sNjgCn-u8R545Au8ypEXyH_2Kf5mWtgzP_qRw6aPAwY/edit?gid=1024872528#gid=1024872528" class="external-link">participant
tracker</a>, and recruited participants, most of your work is already
done!</p>
<p>Before each study session, send a reminder to your participants and,
if appropriate, include the link to the video conferencing tool you will
be using (e.g. the link to the Zoom room). In your participant tracker,
mark down that you sent the reminder.</p>
<p>Before the session begins, make a unique copy of your script and
include the anonymous ID you’ve assigned to the session participant in
the title. Have this copy open so you can read along and take notes. We
recommend making your notes another color like blue so you can easily
distinguish what you should say aloud from your notes. Link to this copy
in your tracker.</p>
<p>During the session, participants will need to share their screen.
Encourage them to only share the needed application (e.g. a browser
window if the product being evaluated is online) and when sending survey
questions, tell the participant they can open the survey in a different
browser window so that they have privacy when responding. Make sure
these suggestions are included in your study script so you don’t forget
to say them.</p>
<p>With small studies, getting more qualitative data (i.e. non-numerical
data) can help ensure you gather rich insights and don’t rely too
heavily on interpreting trends from small sample sizes. To gather this
data, when orienting your participants, tell them you would like them to
think-aloud while they work on tasks. This is somewhat unnatural and
might slow participants down—if you are using time as a metric, you
might reconsider this approach. However, if you want to get more
information on participants’ impressions, it can be quite helpful. You
might use prompts like, “What are you thinking?” or “Tell me what’s
going through your head,” if they need reminding to think aloud.</p>
<p>Sometimes participants might quit a task without finishing it or may
get quite lost while attempting to carry out the task. Assure them that
this is okay and you are learning a lot from them. It is very important
to not give any hints—you won’t be there to do that for real users. Have
links and any needed information on hand to send to participants so that
when they begin a new task, they can do so regardless of how
successfully they carried out the previous task.</p>
<p>It is tempting to want to fill gaps in conversation. However, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/intentional-silence-ux/" class="external-link">intentional
silence can be a powerful technique for moderation</a> and learning more
from participants. Try to hold silences past your comfort point so that
your participant fills the space and not you. Wait with a relaxed
manner. If your participant asks a question, try offering a
noncommittal, “Hmmm,” or, if this is during a follow up interview, you
can encourage them to go on by saying, “Tell me more about that.”</p>

<p>If you are a part of a team with the capacity for more than one
person to help with rapid usability testing, it can be helpful to plan
for different roles and responsibilities during a session. For example,
you might have a moderator verbally facilitate the session, a notetaker
make and record real-time observations, and a tech role to manage
recording, pasting in the meeting chat, and any other troubleshooting.
Allowing for multiple roles–especially if a recording is not
possible–can help each individual stay more focused and present in their

<p>In breakout rooms, you and a partner will act as study facilitator
and participant in a rapid usability test. To save time, in this
scenario, we will skip some other portions of orienting participants and
the usual warm up questions.</p>
<p>Choose your roles, have the participant share a browser window in
Zoom, then have the facilitator read the script aloud and the
participant engage in the assigned task. The facilitator can take notes
in the place of their choice. Swap roles if you have time. We’ll discuss
the exercise as a group when you’re done.</p>
<p><strong>SCRIPT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facilitator:</strong> “While you work, please think-aloud as
much as you can. That just means narrating out loud what you are doing,
what you’re looking for, what you’re thinking. That will help me
understand your thought process. If you fall silent for a little while,
I’ll remind you to think-aloud. Otherwise I’m going to stay as quiet as
possible until we reach the interview portion. Any questions?”</p>
<p><strong>Facilitator:</strong> “Ok. This is a link to the US-RSE
website.” <em>Send link via chat: <a href="https://us-rse.org/" class="external-link uri">https://us-rse.org/</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Facilitator:</strong> “Your first task is to go there and
find information on how you could receive a financial award from US-RSE
to support your work. Let me know when you’ve found the information.”
<em>Remind participants to think-aloud if they fall silent too long
while working. Take notes.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After the session is over, store the recording into a private folder
for raw data. Zoom will produce a transcript but services like Dovetail
and Otter.ai also provide helpful audio transcription and sync the
recording to the transcript itself. Review the transcript and anonymize
it, removing names and identifiable information. Keep in mind that
specific details about research projects can be very identifying. The <a href="https://qdr.syr.edu/guidance/human-participants/deidentification" class="external-link">Qualitative
Data Repository</a> has useful information on how to anonymize
transcripts, as does <a href="https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/anonymisation/anonymising-qualitative-data/" class="external-link">this
article from the UK Data Service</a>. Save this anonymized version in a
separate folder from the raw data. Link in your tracking spreadsheet to
the anonymized version.</p>
<p>It is also recommended to go through the recording on your own to
note when there are long pauses or where a user’s mouse was hovering
when they were looking for a particular feature. This non-verbal
information can be helpful in understanding your user’s mindset and
assumptions.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>To learn from your participants’ behavior and think-alouds, you will
need to review and label your raw qualitative data. This is sometimes
referred to as coding your data and is <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1191/1478088706qp063oa" class="external-link">a
key step in many qualitative analysis methods</a>. You can use open
coding to apply labels inductively, coming up with new ones as you
proceed. Or, you can work with a coding scheme, a set of predetermined
labels that are relevant to your research question. This is an iterative
process—label your data as soon after you’ve collected it as possible
and return to and revise those labels after you have collected more
data.</p>
<p>The labels you assign are going to represent your data later, so if
you want to be able to talk about what activity people were engaged in
while encountering system errors or what people’s emotions seemed to be
while completing a task, make sure you code for those things.</p>
<p>Tools like Dovetail, Atlas.ti, or Taguette may be used to support
this process, but you can do it without specialized software. The main
thing you need is a way to associate labels for things you care about
with pieces of data like quotes or mouse and click locations. You want
to be able to explore labels assigned to data and, conversely, data
assigned to labels. Excel spreadsheets can accomplish this.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>If you are interested in errors, you may use error categories as part
of your coding scheme. Common error types include: - Failed attempts:
Entering invalid data, such as incorrect login credentials or formatting
errors. - Misnavigation: Navigating to unintended pages or sections. -
Repeated actions: Attempting the same action multiple times
unsuccessfully. - Incomplete tasks: Abandoning a task or failing to
achieve the intended goal. - System errors: Triggering error messages or
encountering broken functionality.</p>
<p>You could also assign a severity to errors. A severity scale you
could use is: - Critical: Prevents users from completing a task (e.g.,
broken functionality or unclear instructions). - Moderate: Slows users
down or causes frustration but doesn’t prevent task completion. - Minor:
Small mistakes with minimal impact on task completion.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="example-a-coded-error">Example: A coded error<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#example-a-coded-error"></a>
</h3>
<p>What counts as errors are up to you; we recommend adopting a user’s
perspective though. If they think there’s a problem, document that
somehow.</p>
<p>Here, a participant thinks there is an error because they haven’t
seen any changes. The facilitator running the session might know that
the tool is working but because the user thinks there was a problem, the
error was labeled with two codes—Error: moderate and Error: no status
update. These describe the type and severity.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>The quote below is a fictional participant thinking aloud while
trying to reserve some nodes for their analysis work; they’re describing
filling out a form.</p>
<p>“I’m just filling in my information in the form. I need two GPUs so
I’ll enter that here. Okay, I’m….I’m just reviewing to make sure things
are correct. Alright, we’re good. I can hit submit. Oh. Wait. I guess I
forgot something. Oh just checking that box. Okay now we’re good.”</p>
<p>Read the quote a couple of times and then, in the Zoom poll, list
some labels you might apply to the quote if you were studying how easy
it is for users to make those reservations. Labels can be a single word
or short phrases. Separate labels with commas (,) or slashes ().</p>

they take. You might label the error types or their severity. You can

reserve nodes.”</p>

important and try to find patterns in them. Write short memos that

<p>Typically, when using self-report measures, a higher rating would
indicate a more positive response. For example, when using a scale of
1-5, a score of 5 on a question asking how useful a tool is would
indicate a highly useful tool. If you use any self-report measures that
are negatively phrased, such that a higher score means something bad,
you need to <em>reverse score</em> that item. To reverse score, subtract
the rating from the highest score possible plus one. Reverse scoring
should occur before calculating combined metrics.</p>

<p>Your audience will want an explanation of the behavior behind the
metrics. Help them understand what participants were thinking and doing.
You can leverage the memos you have written about emergent patterns and
important examples and you may wish to again review the labeled data
that’s relevant to your research questions. This way you can report on
things like what participants were doing when they encountered critical
errors.</p>
<p>In addition to quantitative results and qualitative explanations, you
should report some actionable insights based on your findings. This is
how your rapid usability test can inform development work. An actionable
insight describes what the insight is (e.g. users’ expectation or a
common problem) and an achievable step you should take next.</p>
<p>There may be many possible next steps you can see but you can
prioritize them by considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the issue negatively impacts your value proposition</li>
<li>The severity of the issue based on how many people it affects and to
what degree</li>
<li>Whether or not your team is able to address the issue in the near
future</li>
</ul>
<p>When reporting actionable insights, don’t hedge, say exactly what
should be done next, e.g. redesign a feature, update documentation,
conduct additional interviews. <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/research-insights/#actionable-insights" class="external-link">GitLab’s
Handbook on UX research</a> has useful suggestions about how to craft
actionable insights.</p>
<p>You may encounter a team member who is skeptical about whether or not
they should act on the results of your study. Generally, an effective
response is to compare to the alternative: you know more now than you
did before the study and you can move forward based on more than gut
instinct. Acknowledge that your sample size may be small, but this is
the norm in UX work and continued engagement with users can help you
gauge how representative your results are. And, just like the software
code itself, the user experience and your understanding of it is
iteratively improved. That’s why we do rapid usability testing—it fits
in with agile work cycles.</p>

<li>Apply a coding scheme to label qualitative data like transcripts.
Iteratively review the data and labels you have applied so that you
represent the data as best you can. You can combine labels together or
make new ones that better represent your data.</li>
<li>Specialized tools are helpful for labeling and exploring qualitative
data but spreadsheets or printed transcripts and post it notes can do
the job too. Whatever your system, you want to be able to explore labels
assigned to data and, conversely, data assigned to labels.</li>
<li>Errors can be labeled by severity or type, allowing you to more
easily recognize which issues are the highest priority.</li>
<li>Evaluate and report on tasks individually so that you have finer
grained insight into users’ experiences. Multiple metrics can help
inform your interpretation of how usable the tool is.</li>
<li>When reporting results, tell your audience what the goal of your
research was, what you did, and who you did it with.</li>
<li>When presenting data, ensure the audience can understand exactly
what metrics mean and provide information like ranges, medians, and
modes to assist with interpretation.</li>
<li>Leverage the labeled data to help you report trends in what
participants were doing, thinking, and feeling throughout their
tasks.</li>
<li>An actionable insight describes what the insight is (e.g. uses’
expectation or a common problem) and an achievable, concrete step you
